🔘 Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository contains my practice and learning journey of Data Structures and Algorithms using C++.


I created this repo to keep track of what I learn, practice coding questions, and revise concepts for interviews and placements. Most of the codes here are written in a simple way so that anyone learning DSA can understand them.


Why this repository?
I started learning DSA to improve my problem-solving skills and to prepare for coding interviews. Instead of just solving questions randomly, I decided to organize everything topic-wise in one place.

🔘 This repository includes:

✅ Basic to advanced DSA concepts
✅ Clean and simple C++ implementations
✅ Practice problems
✅ Well-structured folders by topic
✅ Interview-focused questions
✅ Beginner-friendly code

🔘 This repo helps me to:

▪️Revise DSA concepts
